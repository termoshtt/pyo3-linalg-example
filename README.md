Q & A
-------

- Cannot find OpenBLAS when `import` extension in Python interpreter
  ```
  ImportError: libopenblas.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  ```
  Please link OpenBLAS statically
  
  ```toml
  [dependencies.ndarray-linalg]
  version = "0.12.0"
  features = ["static"]
  ```
  
- Cannot build wheel with manylinux
  ```
  ðŸ’¥ maturin failed
  Caused by: Failed to ensure manylinux compliance
  Caused by: Your library is not manylinux compliant because it links the following forbidden libraries: ["libgfortran.so.5"]
  ```
  It is not supported yet. Please use `maturin build --manylinux=off`
